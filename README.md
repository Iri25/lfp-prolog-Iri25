# list-backtracking
The project contains several list and backtracking problems solved using Prolog.

The [Prolog 1](https://github.com/Iri25/lfp-prolog-Iri25/tree/master/Prolog%201) folder contains 2 problems with lists solved:
- A predicate that tests the equality of two sets, without appealing to the difference of two sets.
- A predicate that selects the nth element of a list.

The [Prolog 2](https://github.com/Iri25/lfp-prolog-Iri25/tree/master/Prolog%202) folder contains 2 problems with lists solved:
- To interclassify two sorted lists without keeping duplicates.
- A heterogeneous list is given, consisting of integers and lists of sorted numbers. To interclassify all sublists without keeping duplicates. `For example : [1, [2, 3], 4, 5, [1, 4, 6], 3, [1, 3, 7, 9, 10], 5, [1, 1, 11], 8] => [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11]`.

The [Prolog 3](https://github.com/Iri25/lfp-prolog-Iri25/tree/master/Prolog%203) folder contains 1 backtracking problems solved:
- The string a1,..., year is given. It is required to determine all the strictly increasing substrings of the string a.
